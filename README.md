## Introduction
You could probably find a lot of informations about Big data ecosystems pretty much everywhere on the net with vaguely explanation that may lead to confusions for many newcomer.
So, this series intended to help reducing those confusions (or perhaps puzzled you even more, I will try my best.). This series will give you a real-world scenarios and explanation
about the choices of the all software used in this ecosystem related to the scenarios. I WILL NOT talk about the concept of Big Data here, you can find it easily on Internet 
so, Google it.
## Data
I will used the Human Resources Analytics dataset on Kaggle at this: https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics

  ### Cassandra
  Well, pretty much every company that want to step into the world of Big data already have existing systems. You need the place to store your data, very very big place. You also need 
  scalability and high availability which is pretty common requirement for every data warehouse or data lake. We have 4 popular NoSQL Databases to chose from MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase and HBase
  All of them have REST interface for web application, all of them claimed to run faster than other and all of the have interfaces to integrate with other Big data related products within Apache family.
  So I will use the one I familiar with the most and easier to set-up. I will try other Storage and compare them later. Let's begin with Cassandra, click here: https://github.com/Celynaria/HadoopEcosystem/blob/master/Cassandra/Installation.md.
  ### Hadoop

  ### HBase

  ### Sqoop

  ### Will add more later.
